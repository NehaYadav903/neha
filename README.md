I'm Neha , Full Stack Developer

 This year I have completed a full-stack Web Development Bootcamp Program at Lighthouse Labs, took time to practice and now I am ready for my next step!

Through continuous self-study I have been building a solid foundation in both front-end and back-end technologies, focusing on Front-end Developer.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m working on improving my techskills and becoming better at coding<br/>
ðŸŒ± I continue to learn how to combine powerful visualization components and a data-driven approach to DOM manipulation.<br/> 
ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking for new and exciting opportunities to use my previous experience and newly acquired skills<br/>
ðŸ¥… 2022 Goal: Find a hybrid role in Web Development<br/>
